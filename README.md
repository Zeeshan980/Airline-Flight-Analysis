The goal of this project is to identify patterns and trends in the data that can be used to improve the overall efficiency and customer experience of the airline industry.

To get started with this project, you can download the project files from GitHub. The code for the analysis is written in R and can be run in a Rstudio. You will need to have Rstudio and the necessary libraries installed on your computer to run the code.

The dataset contains approximately 1 million rows and 21 columns, and includes information about domestic flights in the United States. The dataset is quite large and can take a while to load and process.

Various data acquisition and data wrangling techniques to filter out irrelevant data and make it more stable for analysis. The team researched various websites and open-source data sharing platforms and finalized the January and February flight information for 2019, which had enough rows for manipulation. We added two more datasets for the year 2020 for both months to merge it into a final one, which made it easier to perform analysis.
